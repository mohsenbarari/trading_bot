Resume base: `aa2c06a573dfd60051e142146f55d7965f2242a7`

| Stage | Status | Gate | Primary output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `P1-00` | `IN_PROGRESS` | amended exit gate after Codex `CHANGES_REQUIRED` on `5ec75ec5`; leftover freeze is `P1-00b` | current-state dossier and blocker register |
| `P1-00b` | `PROPOSED` | canonical-plan amendment; execution after Codex APPROVE and Coordinator `execution-order.yaml` update | remaining current-behavior freeze |
| `P1-01` | `PROPOSED` | policy approved; execution blocked by `P1-00`, `P1-00b` and exact batch receipts | cleanup/retention execution |
| `P1-02` | `PROPOSED` | scenario contract approved; blocked by `P1-00`, `DPL-1` (including `DR-015` measured durations) and `DOC-3` | topology-neutral configuration |
| `P1-03` | `PROPOSED` | scenario/ownership contract approved; dependencies not complete | target runtime topology |
| `P1-04` | `PROPOSED` | scenario/data contract approved; dependencies not complete | shared Finland data plane |
| `P1-05` | `PROPOSED` | scenario/merge contract approved; dependencies and Assignment open | deterministic data-merge rehearsal |
| `P1-06` | `PROPOSED` | scenario/acceptance contract approved; dependencies and execution evidence open | differential staging acceptance |
| `P1-07` | `PROPOSED` | scenario/cutover contract approved; dependencies, evidence and production authorization open | controlled cutover |
| `P1-08` | `PROPOSED` | scenario/closure contract approved; cutover, Iran standby, evidence and per-resource authorization open | closure/decommission |

## `P1-00` execution receipt

This refresh was documentation and side-effect-free characterization only. It did
not provision, restart, deploy, change DNS, write runtime state, copy production
data or delete anything.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Resume / inventory base | `aa2c06a573dfd60051e142146f55d7965f2242a7` |
| Historical plan-base | `b8333ea4` |
| Repository worktree | registered Stage worktree `stage-P1-00-refresh` |
| Last observed production release | `e533d415f1fe085a251d8e6df2016fa775d86702` on both current Finland roles; `NOT_REOBSERVED` |
| Last observed database migration head | `ff6c7d8e9f01` on both current application databases; `NOT_REOBSERVED` |
| Runtime access this Assignment | none; live host facts `NOT_REOBSERVED` |
| Target SSH fingerprint | `SHA256:bwxz2aeBwy0ZNOMMCVdRhaW//TkeALqt6etTQa3NINs`; `NOT_REOBSERVED` |
| External writes | none |
| Secret values collected | none |

Completed technical evidence in this refresh:

- static inventories keep original `generated_from_commit` `19087ff0...` and add
  `verified_against_commit` `aa2c06a5...`; live method/path/filter/guard/job
  semantics still match 217 / 203 / 30 / 15 with zero unclassified items;
- six previously empty `test_refs` closed by
  `tests/test_p1_00_characterization_six_gaps.py`;
- persona/tier/time/failure source compacted to
  `inventory/scenario-records.json` schema `two-server-refactor.scenario-records.v2`
  with real family contracts, definite composed eligibility, seed mapping and
  named invalid combinations; Cartesian expansion is not stored in Git;
- `DR-015` classified `DEFERRED_BLOCKER` / `DPL-1` (`NOT_OBSERVED`); measured
  durations are required later; estimate and production rehearsal remain forbidden;
- sanitised checksums recomputed in `evidence-index.md`.

## Why `P1-00` is not `COMPLETE`

The owner historically accepted the dossier, drift register, twelve-family
behavior baseline, Web/Bot contracts and runtime-ownership seed on 2026-09-02.
The Stage still requires Codex Final Review of the exact correction commit on
this Stage branch. Worker status is only `COMPLETE_CANDIDATE`.

Residual items that do not by themselves keep `P1-00` blocked:

1. `DR-015` — deploy/restart/backup/restore duration has no already-observed
   measurement. Codex decided this is `DEFERRED_BLOCKER` with
   `resolution_stage: DPL-1`. Required evidence is measured deploy, independent
   API/Bot restart, backup, and restore+verification durations. Do not estimate
   or rehearse in production. `P1-02` must not start before `DPL-1` completes.
2. Live host capacity/release/schema facts remain `NOT_REOBSERVED` because this
   Assignment has `external_access: NONE`. That is accepted for this snapshot and
   is not enough for later staging/cutover.

Until Codex Final Reviewer issues `APPROVE` for the exact integration commit,
`P1-01` may be reviewed but no cleanup is authorized and `P1-02..P1-07` must not
change application behavior. Coordinator updates `execution-order.yaml` for
`P1-00b` only after that `APPROVE`. The amended `P1-00` exit gate has no
unresolved High; leftover current-behavior freeze is owned by `P1-00b`.
