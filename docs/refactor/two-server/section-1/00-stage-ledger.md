## `P1-00` execution receipt

This refresh was documentation and side-effect-free characterization only. It did
not provision, restart, deploy, change DNS, write runtime state, copy production
data or delete anything.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Resume / inventory base | `aa2c06a573dfd60051e142146f55d7965f2242a7` |

| Last observed production release | `e533d415f1fe085a251d8e6df2016fa775d86702` on both current Finland roles; `NOT_REOBSERVED` |
| Last observed database migration head | `ff6c7d8e9f01` on both current application databases; `NOT_REOBSERVED` |

Completed technical evidence in this refresh:

- static inventories keep original `generated_from_commit` `19087ff0...` and add
  `verified_against_commit` `aa2c06a5...`; live method/path/filter/guard/job
  semantics still match 217 / 203 / 30 / 15 with zero unclassified items;
- six previously empty `test_refs` closed by
  `tests/test_p1_00_characterization_six_gaps.py`;
- persona/tier/time/failure source compacted to
  `inventory/scenario-records.json` schema `two-server-refactor.scenario-records.v2`
  with real family contracts, definite composed eligibility, seed mapping and
  named invalid combinations; Cartesian expansion is not stored in Git;
- `DR-015` classified `DEFERRED_BLOCKER` / `DPL-1` (`NOT_OBSERVED`); measured
  durations are required later; estimate and production rehearsal remain forbidden;
- sanitised checksums recomputed in `evidence-index.md`.

## Why `P1-00` is `COMPLETE`

Codex Final Reviewer issued `APPROVE` for exact integration commit
`a0f22b7d476429974b9d4c8a7ae3d0d5e4a99be9` on Assignment
`WA-P1-00-SCOPE-20260903-002`. Receipt:
`docs/refactor/two-server/reviews/P1-00-WA-P1-00-SCOPE-20260903-002.md`.

Leftover current-behavior freeze is owned by `P1-00b`. `P1-01` and implementation
Stages remain blocked by `P1-00b`. `DR-015` still blocks `P1-02` until `DPL-1`.
`DR-018` stays `NOT_REINSPECTED`.

Residual items that do not reopen `P1-00`:

1. `DR-015` — deploy/restart/backup/restore duration has no already-observed
   measurement. Codex decided this is `DEFERRED_BLOCKER` with
   `resolution_stage: DPL-1`. Required evidence is measured deploy, independent
   API/Bot restart, backup, and restore+verification durations. Do not estimate
   or rehearse in production. `P1-02` must not start before `DPL-1` completes.
2. Live host capacity/release/schema facts remain `NOT_REOBSERVED` because this
   Assignment has `external_access: NONE`. That is accepted for this snapshot and
   is not enough for later staging/cutover.
3. Supporting human labels in some inventory docs still mention the superseded
   Assignment; Codex recorded this as MEDIUM for the next authorized
   documentation change (`P1-00b`).
